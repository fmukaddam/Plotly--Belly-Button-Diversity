# Plotly - Belly Button Biodiversity
Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. <br>
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Steps involved in Coding
1) Built functions and pulled Data from the json file. <br>
2) Created a dashboard using HTML and its tags
3) Built a Graph and a Bubble Chart which displays data linked to the demographic table
4) Made the dashboard interactive such that when a new data was selected from the dropdown, the charts display the change
